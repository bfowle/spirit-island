# Ember-Eyed Behemoth

```admonish success title="Mechanics Wiki-verified"
Card data, innate thresholds, special rules, growth options, presence track, and suggested-draft cards below were parsed deterministically from the Spirit Island Wiki via `scripts/wiki-fetch.py` (MediaWiki API → raw wikitext → template field extraction — no LLM summarization). Remaining `[VERIFY]` items: Play Difficulty (not in Wiki spirit template; spirit panel only), **aspect mechanics** (aspect-page parser pending), live mindwanderer stats, and board ratings (play data).

## Spirit Overview — Framing

**Wiki-printed playstyle note**:

> Slowly but consistently stomps its Incarna around the island, smashing Invaders. (Dahan can keep clear, unless it really gets going.) Benefits from spread-out Sacred Site, both for targeting Powers and for moving its Incarna long distances. Adding Presence at its Incarna (which can count as Presence) can make it easier to get Presence into new lands, particularly non-Jungles.

Strategic framing `[VERIFY: enhance with play experience]`.

## Starting Setup

> Put 2 Presence and {{incarna|behemoth}}, Unempowered ({{incarna|unempowered}}) side up, in the highest-numbered Wetland on your starting board that is adjacent to any Jungle. You start with your 4 Unique Power Cards and 0 Energy.

## Growth Options (one)

| Growth | Effects |
|--------|---------|
| G1 | first=reclaim, second=gain1p |
| G2 | first=addpresence3junglepresence, second=addpresence0 |
| G3 | first=gain1p, second=addpresence1, third=energy3 |
| G4 | first=reclaimallfire, second=empowerbehemoth, third=moveincarnabehemoth |

**Growth token reference** (Wiki shorthand):
- `reclaim` — Reclaim all discarded Power Cards.
- `gain1p` / `gain2p` — Gain 1 or 2 Power Cards (Minor).
- `addpresence1` / `addpresence2` / `addpresence3` — Add 1 Presence from track, Range N.
- `energy1` / `energy2` / `energy3` — +1/+2/+3 Energy.
- `card1` / `card2` — +1/+2 Card Plays this turn.
- (Other tokens documented on [Wiki Spirit template reference](https://spiritislandwiki.com/) pages.)

## Presence Tracks

As Presence leaves each track, these values are revealed:

- **Energy track**: energy0, energy1, energy2fire, energy3, earth, energy4plant, energy5fire
- **Card-play track**: card1, card2, card2, card3, fireX, card4

## Core Mechanics & Special Rules

### Special Rule

THE BEHEMOTH RISES You have an Incarna ({{incarna|behemoth}}). Once per turn, during the Spirit, Fast, or Slow phase, you may either: * Push {{incarna|behemoth}}; or * Add or Move {{incarna|behemoth}} to any of your Sacred Site on the island. UNRELENTING STRIDES On any turn that you don't use Innate Powers, you may use The Behemoth Rises an additional time. (When you use an Innate Power, cover this Special Rule with a Reminder Marker; when you use this Special Rule, cover your Innate Power.)

### Innate: SMASH, STOMP, AND FLATTEN

- **Speed**: slow · **Range**: None · **Target**: behemoth

_(no thresholds listed in Wiki)_


## Unique Cards (all, Wiki-verified)



## Suggested Draft Cards (Wiki-recommended)

### Minor Powers

_(none in Wiki's suggested list)_

### Major Powers

_(none in Wiki's suggested list)_



## Key Strategic Principles

`[VERIFY and enhance]` — strategic principles should be derived from Wiki-verified mechanics above.

1. Use the Special Rule to its fullest (see above for exact text).
2. Element thresholds drive innate firing — see the innate tables above.
3. Suggested draft cards are Wiki-recommended; pattern-match to your matchup.

## Opening Strategy

`[VERIFY: needs play data]` — opening variants should be rehearsed turn-by-turn per the [SPIRIT_TEMPLATE.md](../../../templates/SPIRIT_TEMPLATE.md) opener format.

## Card Priority Ratings

**Uniques**: see above, all 4 cards are starting-deck and usually all grade A-tier for the spirit's intended playstyle.

**Suggested Minors + Majors**: see tables above. Wiki's suggestions reflect community-recommended drafts.

`[VERIFY: ratings per matchup pending]`.

## Adversary Matchup Matrix

`[VERIFY all grades]` — template only; fill in per-adversary notes after play.

| Adversary            | L0 | L3 | L5 | L6 | Notes `[VERIFY]`     |

## Board / Map Configuration

`[VERIFY via play]` — base boards A–D, Jagged Earth E–H, and thematic ratings pending per-spirit play experience.

## Game-Phase Strategy

`[VERIFY: needs play data]`.

## Synergy Partners (Multiplayer)

`[VERIFY: needs multi-spirit play data]` — archetype-based hints from [Archetype Index](../../combos/archetype-index.md) are the starting point.

## Common Mistakes

`[VERIFY: collect from play]`.

## Tempo Profile

`[VERIFY: per-round targets need playtest]`.

## Expansion Sensitivity

- **Base only**: core Uniques + Innate + Special Rule functional if expansion = Base.
- **+ Branch & Claw**: events + blight deck introduce variance.
- **+ Jagged Earth**: Major/Minor pool deepens.
- **+ Nature Incarnate**: additional aspects may unlock; check the aspect column above.

Per-expansion specifics `[VERIFY]`.
