# Vengeance as a Burning Plague

```admonish success title="Mechanics Wiki-verified"
Card data, innate thresholds, special rules, growth options, presence track, and suggested-draft cards below were parsed deterministically from the Spirit Island Wiki via `scripts/wiki-fetch.py` (MediaWiki API → raw wikitext → template field extraction — no LLM summarization). Remaining `[VERIFY]` items: Play Difficulty (not in Wiki spirit template; spirit panel only), **aspect mechanics** (aspect-page parser pending), live mindwanderer stats, and board ratings (play data).

## Spirit Overview — Framing

**Wiki-printed playstyle note**:

> Not so powerful early, but can be a late-game juggernaut, especially if things are going badly: Blight adds to its Damage and its Presence being Destroyed adds Disease. It may even want to engineer these situations, which can make other Spirits nervous (and be risky if things go poorly).

Strategic framing `[VERIFY: enhance with play experience]`.

## Starting Setup

> 1 of your Presence starts the game already Destroyed. Put 2 Presence on your starting board: 1 in a land with Blight, 1 in a Wetland without Dahan.

## Growth Options (one)

| Growth | Effects |
|--------|---------|
| G1 | first=reclaim, second=gain1p, third=energy1 |
| G2 | first=Vengeance, second=Vengeance |
| G3 | first=gain1p, second=addpresencedisease1, third=energy1 |

**Growth token reference** (Wiki shorthand):
- `reclaim` — Reclaim all discarded Power Cards.
- `gain1p` / `gain2p` — Gain 1 or 2 Power Cards (Minor).
- `addpresence1` / `addpresence2` / `addpresence3` — Add 1 Presence from track, Range N.
- `energy1` / `energy2` / `energy3` — +1/+2/+3 Energy.
- `card1` / `card2` — +1/+2 Card Plays this turn.
- (Other tokens documented on [Wiki Spirit template reference](https://spiritislandwiki.com/) pages.)

## Presence Tracks

As Presence leaves each track, these values are revealed:

- **Energy track**: energy1, energy2, animal, energy3, energy4
- **Card-play track**: card1, card2, fireX, card2, card3, card3, card4

## Core Mechanics & Special Rules

### Special Rule

THE TERROR OF A SLOWLY UNFOLDING PLAGUE When Disease would prevent a Build on a board with your Presence, you may let the Build happen (removing no Disease). If you do, 1 Fear. LINGERING PESTILENCE When your Presence is destroyed by anything except a Spirit action, add 1 Disease where each destroyed Presence was. WREAK VENGEANCE FOR THE LAND'S CORRUPTION Your actions treat Blight on the island as also being Badlands.

### Innate: EPIDEMICS RUN RAMPANT

- **Speed**: fast · **Range**: 1 · **Target**: disease

_(no thresholds listed in Wiki)_


### Innate: SAVAGE REVENGE

- **Speed**: slow · **Range**: 0 · **Target**: building

| Level | Thresholds | Effect |
|-------|------------|--------|
| 1 | 3 Air | This Power has Range +1. |
| 2 | 3 Fire + 1 Animal | 1 Damage. |
| 3 | 4 Fire + 2 Animal | +2 Damage. |
| 4 | 5 Fire + 2 Air + 2 Animal | +3 Damage. |

## Key Strategic Principles

`[VERIFY and enhance]` — strategic principles should be derived from Wiki-verified mechanics above.

1. Use the Special Rule to its fullest (see above for exact text).
2. Element thresholds drive innate firing — see the innate tables above.
3. Suggested draft cards are Wiki-recommended; pattern-match to your matchup.

## Opening Strategy

`[VERIFY: needs play data]` — opening variants should be rehearsed turn-by-turn per the [SPIRIT_TEMPLATE.md](../../../templates/SPIRIT_TEMPLATE.md) opener format.

## Card Priority Ratings

**Uniques**: see above, all 4 cards are starting-deck and usually all grade A-tier for the spirit's intended playstyle.

**Suggested Minors + Majors**: see tables above. Wiki's suggestions reflect community-recommended drafts.

`[VERIFY: ratings per matchup pending]`.

## Adversary Matchup Matrix

`[VERIFY all grades]` — template only; fill in per-adversary notes after play.

| Adversary            | L0 | L3 | L5 | L6 | Notes `[VERIFY]`     |
|----------------------|----|----|----|----|----------------------|
| England              | ?  | ?  | ?  | ?  |                      |
| Brandenburg-Prussia  | ?  | ?  | ?  | ?  |                      |
| Sweden               | ?  | ?  | ?  | ?  |                      |
| France (Plantation)  | ?  | ?  | ?  | ?  |                      |
| Habsburg Mining      | ?  | ?  | ?  | ?  |                      |
| Russia               | ?  | ?  | ?  | ?  |                      |

| Habsburg Livestock   | ?  | ?  | ?  | ?  |                      |

## Board / Map Configuration

`[VERIFY via play]` — base boards A–D, Jagged Earth E–H, and thematic ratings pending per-spirit play experience.

## Game-Phase Strategy

`[VERIFY: needs play data]`.

## Synergy Partners (Multiplayer)

`[VERIFY: needs multi-spirit play data]` — archetype-based hints from [Archetype Index](../../combos/archetype-index.md) are the starting point.

## Common Mistakes

`[VERIFY: collect from play]`.

## Tempo Profile

`[VERIFY: per-round targets need playtest]`.

## Expansion Sensitivity

- **Base only**: core Uniques + Innate + Special Rule functional if expansion = Base.
- **+ Branch & Claw**: events + blight deck introduce variance.
- **+ Jagged Earth**: Major/Minor pool deepens.
- **+ Nature Incarnate**: additional aspects may unlock; check the aspect column above.

Per-expansion specifics `[VERIFY]`.
